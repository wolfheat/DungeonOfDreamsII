[Chorus]
[Verse]
[Chorus]
(record scratching) Like a DJ, Guitar solo, Drum Solo


You got a Dream

[Start]
	
[Verse]
You got a dream, you've got a vision
Don't you agree? Complete this mission
Deep down inside, the answer has grown
Dig deep and find, what you already know

[Chorus]
My game is great, game is fantastic,
I'm not the same, maybe I'm drastic
World passes by, and I got no clue
The game must complete, you have no clue
My game is great, game is fantastic,
I'm not the same, maybe I'm drastic
World passes by, and I got no clue
The game must complete, its all up to you

[Verse]
Early morning to the late of night
You keep on pushing through,
You see a glow throughout your fight
That shine comes from within you

[Chorus]
My game is great,(great) game is fantastic,
I'm not the same,(same) maybe I'm drastic
World passes by,(by by) I got no clue
The game must complete, it is up to you
My game is great,(great) game is fantastic,
I'm not the same,(same) maybe I'm drastic
World passes by,(by by) I got no clue
The game must complete, it is up to you


Female Pop Energetic Ballad
[Piano]
[Verse]
You got a dream, you've got a vision
Don't lose your steam, complete the mission
Gather your strength, alone or on a team
You will succeed, fulfill your dream (fulfill your dream)

[Chorus]
Your game is great, Your game is massive
Your not the same, Your turning passive
As The World pass by, You got no clue
To Complete that Game, You keep pushing through
	
[Verse]
Early morning to the late of night
You strive and you won't budge,
There is no one there to stop your fight
But you are your hardest judge
So stand up straight, head held high and shout (you shout)

[Chorus]
My game is great, My game is massive
I'm not the same, I'm turning passive
As The World pass by, I got no clue
To Complete that Game, I will keep pushing through
	
[End]




		-------------------
		* Julian feedback
		* BUG - Moving slider on Spinner or any Crafting station does not update the amount created text
		* BUG - Agency blob info is text is bugged but should also tell player how agency is gained somehow
		* BUG - Harvesting a stone, saving and reloading game, keeps stone as allready harvested but without red indicator
		* CHANGE - player get already harvested notification for mining the kiln
		* CHANGE - player is able to move after initiating a tool and before the mini game starts	
		* CHANGE - Spinner seems to queue up objects created, but player cant see this queue
		* SUGGESTION - Spinner should prob have a header showing the name of the station
		* SUGGESTION - the research station should state that the items needed to research wont get comsumed
		* SUGGESTION - would be nice to be able to TAB out of crafting stations

		// These bugs seems to happen after the game already broke some
		* BUG - Game not allowing tools to be dropped? Maybe this should be allowed. If inventory is full player cant pick up anything.
		* BUG - Placing the kiln leaves the icon in the inventory as well as placing it in world, it also gets placed before releasing mouse button, prob as soon as it hits a valid spot?
		* BUG - Stone axe recipes filling up workstations recipe list - photo
		* BUG - equipping a tool when already having a tool equipped but no free space in inventory destroyes/"player lose" the removed tool
		* BUG - After a few seconds in the workstation the output changes to show the players inventory instead		
		* BUG - Time seems to have stopped at 12:40 on day 7	
			
		* Completing ballpeople task before activating the ballperson wont make it possible to complete the task?
		* small spelling error in the notice after exiting the fissure he -> the
		* player is able to jump when gathering sticks etc
		* No Translation found for seed - picture

		* BUG - Still an issue - Stone axe recipes filling up workstations recipe list - photo Still an issue
			OUTPUT shown below crafting station at this point, saving at this point ruins/removes the save file from showing up in load (the aliv files exists in file system)
		* Going back to main menu unsets the sound settings briefly like half a second or so.
		* Going back to main menu and restarting a new game starts with old name filled in in the input box

		// Picking up stone right before using it for reconstruction messes up the popup amount -Video https://gemoo.com/tools/upload-video/share/625434510884421632?codeId=PYabol9J9lb4B&card=625434507273125888
		* SUGGESTION -  maybe have agency as an item in the compendium that describes more what it is and how to aquire it 


		* having bowl equipped and unequipping it still shows player holding it
		* Unable to save game - video
		* Setting audio for animals to 0 still allowes high volume for birds

		* Interacting with stations does not respond to E if its held or slowly pressed, only reacts to fast type E

		* NOT SURE - using wrong tool on harvested resource shows already harvested, should it be wrong tool notice?


		* SUGGESTION - Could have a light slider in settings, it gets a bit to dark in the night
		* Holding shift and starting to move should start as running, If it supposed to be a toggle for run then it should only switch off if player presses shift again
		* Settings store the sliders in volume at correct position but does not start audiosources at correct volume
		* Stuck in spyglass forever
		-------------------
		




		* SUGGESTION - Speed up boost -> destroys walls in one hit for 10 seconds

		* Implement level saving to file
		* Implement load save or restart

		* Game to fast? - MAYBE
		* Have player auto change tool for what needs to be used
		* Make pickaxe tool instead of sledge hammer
		* Have upgradable tools - MAYBE

		* If something is placed in game that looks like a promise, make sure it has a reward and is not just a mockup

		* // Make sures //
			Fluent Gameplay, Good Controls
			Correct view aspect FOV etc
			Fun - Appeal - Scope
			Replayability	- Have timer? Make player go "I want to beat my score"
							- Secrets have player know how many secrets they found

			Fun -> Not frustrating nor boring -> Player wants to feel Accomplishment - Meaning - Empowerment - UNpredictabillity - Avoidance - Ownership
			Appeal -> Presentation - Fantasy - Readability
			Scope -> 

		* Add animation for picking up items into inventory
		* Add animation for destroying walls

		* Adding functionality to actually pick up the items

		- SETTINGS
		* Gray Out bar when muted - MAYBE
		* Make cleared menu, maybe have darker background area around text and buttons

		 - MECHANICS
		* Make support for left handers
